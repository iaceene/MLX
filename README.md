# MLX
MLX42 is a modern graphical library developed by the 42 Network, designed specifically for students to use in C graphical projects, such as Cub3D or other visual/interactive programs. It is a modern alternative to the original MiniLibX, built on MLX but updated to work with the latest graphics technologies like OpenGL and Metal
